# Blog Application

This is a static blog application built with Next.js. The project involves creating a folder structure to store blog posts, using Markdown files for content, and implementing components and pages to display the blog posts.

## Key Features

1. **Markdown Files**
   - Create at least three sample Markdown files with the following metadata:
     - `title`: The title of the blog post.
     - `date`: The publication date of the blog post.
     - `author`: The author of the blog post.
     - `image`: Image of the blog post.
     - `summary`: A brief summary of the blog post.

2. **Static Generation with `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`**


3. **Pages**
   - **Homepage (`index.js`)**
     - Display the list of blog posts with their titles and summaries.
   - **Blog Post Page (`[slug].js`)**
     - Display the full content of the blog post along with blog post image corresponding to the slug in the URL.

4. **Responsive design**
     - The site is responsive and provides a good user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

5. **Search functionality**
  - Implement a search feature to filter blog posts based blog type.
