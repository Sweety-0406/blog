# Delicious Homemade Pizza Recipe



## Introduction

Who doesn't love a slice of delicious, homemade pizza? With this easy-to-follow recipe, you can create a mouth-watering pizza right in your own kitchen. Whether you're a fan of classic Margherita or you like to load your pizza with all kinds of toppings, this recipe will serve as a perfect base for your culinary creativity.

## Ingredients

### Dough
- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F)
- 3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt

### Sauce
- 1 can (28 ounces) whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar

### Toppings
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- Fresh basil leaves
- Your choice of toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, etc.)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Dough
1. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.
3. Mix until the dough starts to come together. Knead on a lightly floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it has doubled in size.

### Step 2: Make the Sauce
1. While the dough is rising, prepare the pizza sauce. In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Add the whole peeled tomatoes, oregano, salt, pepper, and sugar. Simmer for about 20-25 minutes, breaking up the tomatoes with a spoon as they cook.
3. Once the sauce has thickened, remove it from the heat and let it cool. Blend it if you prefer a smoother consistency.

### Step 3: Assemble the Pizza
1. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.
2. Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and let them rest for about 10 minutes.
3. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each dough ball into a 12-inch circle.
4. Transfer the rolled-out dough to a piece of parchment paper. Spread a layer of the prepared pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
5. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Add your desired toppings.

### Step 4: Bake the Pizza
1. Carefully transfer the assembled pizza (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or a baking sheet.
2. Bake for about 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
3. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves before slicing and serving.

## Conclusion

Enjoy your delicious homemade pizza with family and friends! This versatile recipe allows you to experiment with different toppings and flavors. Happy cooking!
